The site is unresponsive and static, and lacks accessable features. To fix this:
Redesign site to a cohesive, navigable theme.
Make site mobile-freindly by adding resizing elements.
Add alt tags and descriptive texts.

Since this site is most likely desktop-centric, a more mobile-focused, trimmed down portal that presents the most immediate information mobile users want is reccomended.
